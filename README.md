# Association rules on Slay the Spire deck list
Running Association Rules on Slay the Spire deck lists using R.
Perhaps this could discover some synergies between cards, who knows :P

Notes on Slay the Spire run data: I tried scavenging run data online, but I couldn't find much.

The currently used rundata is cloned from https://github.com/Joe-Darling/SlayTheSpire-Data-Analytics, so huge thanks to Joe for collecting them on reddit!

Rather outdated rundata, but that should do it for now. No defect run data to play with :(
