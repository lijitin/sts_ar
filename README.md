# sts_ar
Running Association Rules on Slay the Spire deck lists using R.

Notes on Slay the Spire run data: I tried scavenging run data online, but I couldn't find much.

The currently used rundata is cloned from https://github.com/Joe-Darling/SlayTheSpire-Data-Analytics, which is almost a year old.

Rather outdated rundata, but that should do it for now.

~ extract deck lists from rundata
