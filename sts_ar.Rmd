# An attempt in running association rules on deck sets in Slay the Spire.

## Loading a single run
```{r}
library(rjson)

path <- "C:/myapps/SlayTheSpire-Data-Analytics/rundata/user1/IRONCLAD" # directory path for the .run files being read
temp <- list.files(path, pattern="*.run", full.names=TRUE)  # store the full filepaths of all the .run files as a chr vector
deck_list <- vector(mode = "character", length = length(temp))
for(i in seq(temp)){
  d <- fromJSON(file = temp[i])
  deck_list[i] <- d$master_deck
}
rm(d)

setwd("C:/myapps/sts_ar")
write.csv(deck_list, file = "user1_ironchad.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
